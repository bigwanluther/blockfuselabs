        <h3>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h3>
        <small>Dear Eileen,</small>
        <p>We are happy your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your phD net year.I will answer your questions one by one,in the following sections.</p>
        <h3>Starting dates</h3>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us atbany time,however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester;the dates for each one are as follows</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester:9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester:15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester:2 May 2017</li>
    
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok,and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="">important university dates.</a> on our website</p>
      		 <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
       	 <p>At the awesome sciece faculty, we have a pretty open-research facility - as long as the Subjects fall somewhere inside the realm of scienceand technology. You seems like an intellegent, dedicated researcher, and just a kind of person we'd like to to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas submitted intrigued by are as follows , in order of priority:
             </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benefits of Reversal (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&degC(86&degF),when the<br>audience size exponencially increase (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
            <li><b><abbr title="name">HTML</abbr></b> and <b><abbr title="name">CSS</abbr></b>constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            
     
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,including how long you'd expect the<br>research to make,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know?Thanks.</p>
            
      <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
      <p>yes,you are right! As part of my work,i did study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question,<br>my favourite dances are as follows,with definitions:</P>
      
      <p>Polynesian chicken dance<br>
    <uL>A little known but very influencial dance dating back as far as 300BC,a whole village would dance around<br>in a circle like chickens,to encourage their live stostock to be "fruitful".</ul></p>
      
      <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
      <ul>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance, which<br>invoved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br>tiny very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inpired<br>modern styles such as <b>Twerking</b>.</ul></p>
      
      <p>Artic robot dance<br>
      <ul>An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic",stited movements,being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br> because they were really cold.</ul></p>
      
      <p>for more of my research,see my <a href="">exotic dance research page.</a></p>
      
      <p>yours sincerely,</p>
